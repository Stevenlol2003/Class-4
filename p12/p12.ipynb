    "\n",
    "For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Functions:\n",
    "- `download`\n",
    "- `parse_html`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Data Structures:\n",
    "- `institutions_df`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:\n",
    "* **Avoid using loops to iterate over pandas dataframes and instead use boolean indexing.**\n",
    "* Do **not** use `loc` to look up data in **DataFrames** or **Series**, unless you are explicitly told to do so. You are **allowed** to use `iloc`.\n",
    "* Do **not** use **absolute** paths such as `C://ms//cs220//p12`. You may **only** use **relative paths**.\n",
    "* Do **not** leave irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.\n",
    "* **Avoid** calling **slow** functions multiple times within a loop.\n",
    "* Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/blob/main/p12/rubric.md)."
